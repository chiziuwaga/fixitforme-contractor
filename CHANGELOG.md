# Project Refactoring Changelog

This document tracks the major architectural and functional changes made to the FixItForMe application.

## Session 1: Foundational Refactor & AI Agent Correction

### Application Flow & Structure
-   **DELETED:** The temporary `UI/UX Page Viewer` (`src/components/DevPageViewer.tsx`) has been removed to eliminate confusion.
-   **REFACTORED:** The application entry point (`/app/page.tsx`) now functions as a proper router, directing users to `/login`, `/contractor/onboarding`, or `/contractor/dashboard` based on their authentication and profile status.
-   **DELETED:** The old, non-functional onboarding flow (`/app/contractor/onboarding/page.tsx` and its hook) was removed.
-   **ADDED:** A new, fully functional, multi-step onboarding process has been created. It correctly saves contractor data to the Supabase `contractor_profiles` table upon completion.

### Settings Page
-   **COMPLETED:** The Settings page (`/app/contractor/settings/page.tsx`) is now fully functional.
-   **ADDED:** `ProfileEditor.tsx` and its `useProfile.ts` hook allow users to update their company profile.
-   **ADDED:** `DocumentUploader.tsx` and its `useDocumentUploader.ts` hook allow users to upload files to Supabase Storage.
-   **ADDED:** `SubscriptionManager.tsx` and its `useSubscription.ts` hook display the user's current plan.

### AI Chat System
-   **REFACTORED:** All agent API routes (`/api/agents/alex`, `/api/agents/rex`, `/api/agents/lexi`) have been rewritten.
    -   Restored essential conversational context and "How to work with me" examples.
    -   Strengthened instructions for the AI to return a single, valid JSON object, improving reliability.
    -   Implemented logic for each agent to intelligently select the correct UI asset to generate based on the user's query, as specified in the `Agent_JSON_Assets_Specification.md`.
-   **REFACTORED:** The `EnhancedChatManager.tsx` component was updated to correctly parse the structured JSON responses from the agents and manage the state for multiple chat windows.
-   **REFACTORED:** The `EnhancedChatWindow.tsx` component was improved to render all generative UI assets and follow-up prompts returned by the AI.

### **2. Deleting Old Dashboard Components**

To keep the codebase clean, I am removing the old, outdated dashboard components and their corresponding hook. The logic will be consolidated into the new `useDashboard` hook.

```typescriptreact file="src/components/dashboard/QuickStats.tsx" isDeleted="true"
