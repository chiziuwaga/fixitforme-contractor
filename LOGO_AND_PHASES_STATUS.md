# FixItForMe Logo Integration & Remaining Phases Status

## ðŸŽ¨ Logo Integration Status

### Current Logo Assets
- **Location**: `public/logo.png` âœ… 
- **Favicon**: `public/favicon.ico` âœ…
- **Metadata Reference**: Layout.tsx references logo âœ…

### Logo Implementation Checklist
- [ ] **Updated Logo**: Ensure the Felix Gold house + Forest Green tools logo you pasted is properly saved
- [ ] **Favicon Generation**: Create 16x16, 32x32, 180x180 favicon variants from logo
- [ ] **App Icon**: Generate app icon variants (192x192, 512x512) for PWA
- [ ] **Brand Consistency**: Verify logo appears consistently across all pages
- [ ] **Loading States**: Add logo to loading spinners and splash screens

### Action Required: Logo File Update
The logo you pasted (Felix Gold house outline with Forest Green tools) needs to be properly saved to replace the current `public/logo.png`. This will ensure GitHub has the correct asset reference.
