### üé® **Frontend Component Implementation**

#### **`GenerativeAgentAssets.tsx`**
- **Complete UI Asset System**: Renders all agent-specific UI components
- **Type-Safe Implementation**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data types
- **Interactive Components**: Progress tracking, tier comparisons, material breakdowns, lead opportunities
- **Action System**: Button handlers for agent interactions and follow-up prompts

**Supported UI Asset Types:**
- `onboarding_progress` - Lexi's profile setup tracking
- `tier_comparison` - Benefits analysis and upgrade prompts
- `material_breakdown` - Alex's supplier research and pricing
- `lead_opportunity` - Rex's individual lead details with scoring
- `system_message` - Conversational limit enforcement

### üìã **Phased Plan Updates**
- **Enhanced Reference Documents**: Added all new documentation to guiding principles
- **Phase 2 Completion**: Marked agent integration and generative UI as complete
- **Phase 3 Completion**: Rex lead generation and job feed implementation finished
- **Real-time Intelligence**: All agents now have live data access and advanced capabilities

### üîç **Key Technical Achievements**

#### **1. Real-time Data Integration**
- Lexi queries Supabase for contractor profiles, subscriptions, and usage data
- Dynamic system prompts with personalized context and recommendations
- Peer benchmarking with anonymous aggregated market data

#### **2. AgentQL Enhancement**
- Alex: Live material pricing with supplier comparisons and availability
- Rex: Multi-platform lead discovery with quality filtering
- Location-aware intelligence for both material sourcing and lead generation

#### **3. Generative UI System**
- Complete component library for all agent interactions
- Type-safe data structures for complex UI assets
- Interactive charts, progress tracking, and action handlers

#### **4. Intelligence Architecture**
- Felix 40-problem framework integration across all agents
