# Enhanced Agent Capabilities & Generative UI Assets Rationale

## üéØ **ALEX THE ASSESSOR - ENHANCED MATERIAL RESEARCH CAPABILITIES**

### **AgentQL Integration for Dynamic Project Scoping**

Alex needs sophisticated material research capabilities that go beyond static databases. Here's the enhanced architecture:

\`\`\`typescript
// Alex's Enhanced AgentQL Integration
interface AlexAgentQLCapabilities {
  // Dynamic material price research
  material_research: {
    home_depot_scraper: string;
    lowes_scraper: string; 
    menards_scraper: string;
    local_supplier_network: string[];
  };
  
  // Project scope analysis
  scope_analyzer: {
    // Felix 40-problem expansion
    problem_categories: FelixCategory[];
    // Dynamic project requirements
    requirement_extractor: AgentQLQuery;
    // Code and permit research
    permit_requirement_scraper: AgentQLQuery;
  };
  
  // Market intelligence
  competitive_analysis: {
    // Pricing intelligence from contractor sites
    competitor_pricing_scraper: AgentQLQuery;
    // Regional labor rate research
    labor_market_analyzer: AgentQLQuery;
  };
}

// AgentQL Dynamic Query Generation for Alex
const generateMaterialQuery = (projectType: string, location: string, specifications: any) => {
  return {
    query: `{
      products[] {
        product_name
        product_price(include currency and unit)
        product_specifications
        availability_status
        store_location
        reviews_rating
        bulk_pricing_options
      }
      delivery_options {
        same_day_delivery
        delivery_cost
        minimum_order
      }
    }`,
    context: {
      search_terms: generateSearchTerms(projectType, specifications),
      location_filter: location,
      price_comparison: true,
      quality_threshold: "commercial_grade"
    }
  };
};

// Felix Framework Integration with Dynamic Expansion
const felixPlusAgentQL = {
  // Core Felix Categories (40 problems)
  felix_base: FELIX_40_PROBLEMS,
  
  // AgentQL Dynamic Expansion
  dynamic_categories: {
    // Auto-discover new problem types
    emerging_problems: AgentQLQuery,
    // Regional specializations
    regional_variations: AgentQLQuery,
    // Seasonal considerations
    seasonal_factors: AgentQLQuery
  },
  
  // Scope Intelligence
  scope_detection: {
    // Automatically identify project complexity
    complexity_analyzer: AgentQLQuery,
    // Hidden work identification
    hidden_requirement_detector: AgentQLQuery,
    // Code compliance checker
    code_requirement_scraper: AgentQLQuery
  }
};
\`\`\`
