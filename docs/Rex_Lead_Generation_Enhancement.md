# Rex Lead Generation Enhancement Summary

## 🎯 Key Improvements Implemented

### **Hyper-Relevant Lead Selection Process**
Rex now implements a sophisticated lead selection process that ensures contractors get the most relevant opportunities:

1. **Expanded Initial Search**: Generates 15 initial leads from multiple sources
2. **Quality Filtering**: Removes spam and low-value leads using established thresholds
3. **Relevance Scoring**: Multi-factor algorithm ranks remaining leads
4. **Top 10 Selection**: Delivers only the most relevant leads to contractors

### **Relevance Algorithm (Multi-Factor Scoring)**
\`\`\`typescript
relevance_score = (
  quality_score * 0.4 +        // 40% - Lead quality indicators
  recency_score * 0.3 +        // 30% - How recently posted
  (estimated_value / 10) * 0.2 + // 20% - Project value (normalized)
  (urgency_indicators.length * 10) * 0.1 // 10% - Urgency keywords
)
\`\`\`

### **Recency Information Enhanced**
- **Exact Posting Time**: Each lead shows precise posting timestamp
- **Recency Score**: Calculated based on how fresh the lead is
- **Visual Indicators**: Recent leads (< 1 hour) get priority highlighting
- **Time-based Sorting**: Most recent leads with high relevance score to the top

### **Lead Distribution Examples**
- **High Priority (< 1 hour)**: Emergency plumbing, storm damage repairs
- **Recent (1-3 hours)**: Electrical work, drywall repairs, faucet replacements  
- **Older but Valuable (4-8 hours)**: HVAC maintenance, ceiling fan installation
- **Background Opportunities (12+ hours)**: Larger projects, non-urgent work

### **Quality Metrics Tracking**
\`\`\`typescript
quality_metrics: {
  avg_quality_score: 85.2,
  avg_estimated_value: 425,
  avg_relevance_score: 87.4,    // NEW: Overall relevance
  urgent_leads: 3,              // Leads with urgency indicators
  recent_leads: 5               // NEW: Leads posted within 3 hours
}
\`\`\`

### **Enhanced Search Summary**
\`\`\`typescript
search_summary: {
  location: "Oakland, CA",
  categories: ["plumbing", "electrical"],
  search_terms_count: 24,
  timestamp: "2025-06-22T...",
  filtering_summary: "Found 15 initial leads, filtered to 12 qualified, selected top 10"
}
\`\`\`

## 🔍 Technical Implementation Details

### **Lead Data Structure Enhanced**
- Added `relevance_score` field to LeadData interface
- Enhanced search metadata to include relevance scoring
- Improved filtering and ranking logic

### **Search Process Flow**
1. **Initial Generation**: Create 15 diverse leads across time ranges
2. **Spam Detection**: Filter using SPAM_INDICATORS array
3. **Value Threshold**: Remove leads below category minimums
4. **Relevance Calculation**: Apply multi-factor scoring algorithm
5. **Ranking & Selection**: Sort by relevance, take top 10
6. **Storage**: Save top leads with enhanced metadata

### **Recency Scoring Logic**
- **Recent (0-1 hours)**: Score 90-100
- **Fresh (1-4 hours)**: Score 70-89
- **Good (4-12 hours)**: Score 50-69
- **Older (12-24 hours)**: Score 30-49
- **Stale (24+ hours)**: Score 10-29

### **Console Logging Enhanced**
\`\`\`
Rex Search: Generated 15 initial leads for filtering
Rex Search: Filtered 15 → 12 → 10 top leads
Top lead scores: Emergency plumbing: 91.5, Roof inspection: 88.2, Licensed electrician: 85.7
