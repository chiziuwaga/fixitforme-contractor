# FixItForMe: Phased Implementation Plan for Contractor Module

This document outlines a phased development plan for the FixItForMe Contractor Module. The goal is to build a robust, AI-driven platform on Vercel, using Next.js for the frontend, Python for the backend, and Supabase as the central data hub, following a decoupled agentic architecture.

---

## Guiding Principles & Reference Documents

**Success depends on adhering to the architectural vision outlined in the core documents.** All development should align with these specifications.

*   **Primary Specification:** `FixItForMe_Contractor_Module_Specs.md`
*   **Technical Instructions:** `Custom_Instructions_Contractor_FixItForMe.md`
*   **Lead Generation Bible:** `AgentQL_Architecture_for_Contractor_Lead_Generation.md`
*   **Felix's Problem Framework:** `Felix_40_Problem_Reference.md`
*   **Generative UI Reference:** [v0.dev Chat Example](https://v0.dev/chat/b/b_MX1Ev6PvA7e)
*   **v0.dev Contractor Reference:** [Contractor Dashboard UI](https://v0.dev/chat/b/b_MX1Ev6PvA7e)

**Rule for Changes:** Any deviation or new feature proposal must be reflected by an update to these core documents *before* implementation begins. This ensures our documentation remains the single source of truth.

}
```

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Vercel AI SDK & Generative UI:**
    *   âœ… Install and configure the Vercel AI SDK on both the frontend and backend.
    *   âœ… Create a `lib/ai.ts` file (or a similar client-side helper) to manage streaming UI from agent responses, as inspired by the `v0.dev` reference.
    *   âœ… Design the "nested chat window" UI, which will serve as the primary interface for invoking and interacting with AI agents.

2.  **Lexi - The Onboarder:**
    *   âœ… Develop the `/api/agents/lexi` endpoints using streaming responses.
    *   âœ… Implement the "Planner Chain" prompt architecture for Lexi, adhering to her persona defined in `FixItForMe_Contractor_Module_Specs.md`.
    *   ðŸ”„ Build the interactive onboarding UI where Lexi's streamed responses guide the user, updating the `contractor_profiles` table upon completion.

3.  **Alex - The Assessor:**
    *   âœ… Develop the `/api/agents/alex` streaming endpoint.
    *   âœ… Implement the "Analyst Chain" and "Critic Chain" prompt architectures for Alex using Deepseek for reasoning, ensuring his persona matches the spec.
    *   ðŸ”„ Build the "Job Bid View" (`/contractor/bid/[job_id]`), integrating the generative chat UI for contractors to interact with Alex.
    *   ðŸ”„ Render Alex's structured JSON responses (e.g., cost breakdowns) into interactive Mantine components.
    *   ðŸ”„ Persist the full conversation and structured data into the `bids.assistance_data` JSONB column.

4.  **Rex - The Retriever Infrastructure:**
    *   âœ… Develop the `/api/agents/rex` streaming endpoint for monitoring and insights.
    *   âœ… Enhanced with @ mention system and intelligent orchestration
    *   ðŸ”„ Implement the background `/api/agents/rex_run` asynchronous endpoint for lead generation tasks.

## Phase 3: Rex - Lead Generation & Job Feed (Weeks 6-7) ðŸ”„ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

**Objective:** Activate the background lead generation agent (Rex) and populate the contractor's dashboard with a unified feed of jobs and leads.

### **ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:**
- **Supabase Schema**: Complete database setup with RLS policies
- **Authentication Flow**: SMS-based login with contractor verification
- **Rex Background Automation**: Implement tool-user chain architecture
- **Dashboard Integration**: Real-time lead feed with Felix problem mapping
- **Search Interface**: Manual Rex triggers and session management

### **ðŸ“‹ PRIORITY ORDER:**
1. **Database & Auth First** - Essential foundation for all subsequent features
2. **Rex Tool Chain** - Core lead generation engine following AgentQL architecture
3. **UI Component Library** - Render the enhanced JSON outputs from Phase 2
4. **Dashboard Integration** - Merge internal jobs + external leads
5. **Testing & Validation** - End-to-end contractor workflows

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Rex - The Retriever Backend:**
    *   Implement the `/api/agents/rex_run` asynchronous endpoint. This implementation must **strictly follow** the detailed plans in the `AgentQL_Architecture_for_Contractor_Lead_Generation.md` document.
    *   Implement the "Tool User Chain" architecture, where Rex's sole purpose is to execute tools (web scrapers, API clients) to populate the `contractor_leads` table.
    *   Integrate the specified recency scoring and quality control logic as defined in the architecture document.
    *   **Felix Integration**: Map lead problems to the 40-problem framework for quality classification

2.  **Automation & Dashboard Integration:**
    *   Configure a Vercel CRON job to periodically trigger the `/api/agents/rex_run` endpoint.
    *   Implement the data fetching logic on the `/contractor/dashboard` to display a merged, real-time feed from both the `jobs` table (internal) and `contractor_leads` table (external).
    *   **UI Component Rendering**: Build React components for Alex's cost breakdowns, Rex's lead analytics, and Lexi's onboarding checklists

3.  **Search View:**
    *   Build the `/contractor/search` page to allow manual triggering of Rex's runs and to display the remaining monthly search sessions.
    *   **Tier Management**: Implement Growth vs Scale tier session limits and billing logic

### **ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL PREREQUISITES:**
- **Environment Variables**: All API keys configured for live testing
- **Supabase Connection**: Database tables created with proper RLS policies  
- **Vercel Deployment**: Production environment ready for CRON jobs
- **Authentication**: SMS verification flow operational

## Phase 4: Payments, Tiers, & Settings (Weeks 8-9)

**Objective:** Build the complete financial lifecycle for both contractor tiers, including subscriptions and payouts.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Stripe Integration:**
    *   Integrate the Stripe Python SDK for payment processing.
    *   Set up Stripe products for the "Scale" tier subscription.

2.  **Payment & Payout Logic:**
    *   Create the `/api/payments/webhook_handler` to listen for Stripe events.
    *   Implement the differentiated payout logic based on the contractor's `tier`, as defined in the "Payment User Stories" section of `FixItForMe_Contractor_Module_Specs.md`.
        *   **Growth Tier:** 10% platform fee, 30%/40%/30% payout structure.
        *   **Scale Tier:** 7% platform fee, 50%/25%/25% payout structure.
    *   Rigorously track all transactions in the `payments` table.

3.  **Settings & Subscription Management:**
    *   Develop the `/contractor/settings` page for profile and service management.
    *   Integrate the Stripe Customer Portal to allow premium contractors to manage their subscriptions.

---

## Phase 5: Admin, Testing, & Deployment (Weeks 10-12)

**Objective:** Ensure system robustness, provide administrative oversight through backend tooling, and prepare for a successful launch.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Admin Endpoints & Tooling:**
    *   Build secure backend endpoints for administrative actions. The UI for these endpoints is **not** in scope for this phase.
    *   Implement the logic for admin-only tools, such as the `ADMIN_TOOL_view_job_ledger` mentioned in the instructions, which can be called via a secure API.

2.  **End-to-End Testing:**
    *   Use Cypress or Playwright to write E2E tests for all critical user flows, especially the full payment lifecycles for both contractor tiers and agent interaction scenarios.
    *   Test API failure modes and admin intervention paths (by calling the admin APIs directly).

3.  **Hardening & Deployment:**
    *   Implement the defined `handle_payment_failure` and `handle_agent_error` functions for robust error handling.
    *   Set up logging and monitoring via Vercel.
    *   Conduct final testing on the production environment and launch.
