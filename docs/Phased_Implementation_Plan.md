# FixItForMe: Phased Implementation Plan for Contractor Module

This document outlines a phased development plan for the FixItForMe Contractor Module. The goal is to build a robust, AI-driven platform on Vercel, using Next.js for the frontend, Python for the backend, and Supabase as the central data hub, following a decoupled agentic architecture.

## üîë SESSION MANAGEMENT CLARIFICATION

**IMPORTANT**: The platform implements dual-session architecture:
- **Contractor Login Sessions**: 48 hours (secure desktop environment for professional workflow)
- **Agentic Operation Timeouts**: 10 minutes (prevents hanging AI operations, resource management)

This ensures contractors stay logged in across work sessions while maintaining tight control over AI operations. See `/docs/Session_Management_Rationale.md` for detailed implementation.

### **üéØ INDYDEV DAN INTEGRATION - TOOL USER CHAIN ARCHITECTURE:**

**Rex as Specialist Tool User:**
```typescript
// Context: Rich contractor profile and search parameters
const rexContext = {
  contractor_profile: {
    services: ["plumbing", "electrical"], // From Felix framework
    service_areas: ["Oakland", "Berkeley"],
    pricing_tier: "premium",
    availability: "immediate"
  },
  search_parameters: {
    budget_range: [1000, 15000],
    urgency_keywords: ["emergency", "ASAP", "urgent"],
    quality_indicators: ["licensed", "insured", "permit"]
  },
  performance_history: {
    conversion_rates: {plumbing: 0.34, electrical: 0.28},
    avg_project_value: 4500,
    response_time_preference: "24h"
  }
};

// Tool Chain: Specialized execution sequence
const toolChain = [
  "craigslist_scraper", // Primary lead source
  "sams_gov_scraper",   // Government contracts
  "quality_filter",     // Spam detection using AgentQL patterns
  "value_scorer",       // Budget and urgency analysis
  "geo_matcher",        // Service area validation
  "felix_categorizer"   // Map to 40-problem framework
];

// Output: Structured data for generative UI components
const output = {
  leads: [...], // Qualified leads with Felix categories
  analytics: {...}, // Performance metrics for dashboard
  ui_assets: {...}, // Component specifications for React
  quality_score: 0.85 // Overall batch quality indicator
};
```

### **üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:**
1. **Database Schema**: Complete Supabase tables with RLS policies
2. **Rex Background Engine**: Tool User Chain for autonomous lead generation  
3. **Quality Control**: AgentQL spam detection and value thresholds
4. **Relevance Ranking**: Multi-factor scoring (Quality 40% + Recency 30% + Value 20% + Urgency 10%)
5. **Lead Filtering**: Start with 15 leads ‚Üí Filter spam/low-value ‚Üí Rank by relevance ‚Üí Top 10 output
6. **Dashboard Integration**: Real-time lead feed with generative UI components
7. **Recency Display**: Show exact posting time for each lead with visual indicators
8. **CRON Automation**: Scheduled Rex runs for automated lead discovery

### **üìã PRIORITY ORDER:**
1. **Database & Auth First** ‚úÖ Schema designed, need implementation
2. **Rex Tool Chain** üîÑ Background endpoint with Felix search terms  
3. **Quality Control** ‚úÖ AgentQL patterns and value thresholds
4. **Dashboard Integration** üîÑ UI components for lead display with loading states
5. **Testing & Validation** üîÑ End-to-end contractor workflows

### **üéØ FELIX ‚Üí REX INTEGRATION CLARIFICATION:**
**Felix's Role:** Provides Rex with **search vocabulary** and **problem categories** - tells Rex what contractors actually look for.

**Rex's Role:** Uses Felix categories as **search terms** to find leads on Craigslist/SAMs.gov, not complex Felix mapping.

**Correct Approach:**
```typescript
// Rex searches with Felix terms as vocabulary
const searchTerms = ["toilet repair", "roof leak", "drywall patch"]; // From Felix
searchCraigslist(searchTerms, location, budget_range); // Simple search, no mapping
```

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Rex - The Retriever Backend (IndyDev Dan Tool User Chain):**
    *   Implement the `/api/agents/rex_run` endpoint as a robust, asynchronous background task.
    *   The agent will use the contractor's profile (`services`, `service_areas`) to generate search queries for Craigslist, SAM.gov, and other configured sources.
    *   **Crucially, limit higher-tier users to 10 search sessions per month**, tracking usage in the `contractor_profiles` table.
    *   The UI must display a progress bar and stream back status updates during execution.

2.  **Dashboard Job Feed:**
    *   Populate the `/contractor/dashboard` with a real-time feed of leads generated by Rex and jobs referred from the homeowner-facing platform.
    *   Render leads using the `LeadCard` generative UI component.
    *   For Growth tier users, the manual search trigger for Rex will be visible but disabled ("grayed out") with a tooltip/modal prompting an upgrade.

3.  **Alex - The Quote Agent Enhancement:**
    *   Enhance Alex's capabilities to function as the "Quote Agent" for Scale tier users.
    *   When prompted, Alex will perform comparative analysis against home improvement store sites (e.g., Home Depot) based on the user's zip code to validate material costs.
    *   This feature will be disabled for Growth tier users.

- **üåü NEW: Agent Working Indicators**: Real-time progress tracking for Alex and Rex operations

**Objective:** Implement the complete commercial framework, including tiered subscriptions, payment processing, and a comprehensive contractor settings area.

### **üîë USER SESSION & DATA FLOW LOGIC:**

This section details the critical logic for ensuring a secure, personalized, and tier-aware user experience.

1.  **Session-Aware Lead Feed & Bidding:**
    *   **API Endpoint (`/api/leads`):** A dedicated, secure API endpoint will be created to serve the live lead feed.
    *   **Authentication:** This endpoint will require a valid user session (JWT) to be accessed.
    *   **Matching Logic:** On request, the backend will:
        1.  Identify the user from their session.
        2.  Fetch the user's `contractor_profiles` record, specifically their `services` and `service_areas`.
        3.  Query the `leads` table, returning **only** the leads that match the contractor's profile.
    *   **Bidding Rules:**
        *   The frontend will track the number of bids used against the monthly limit defined by the user's tier.
        *   If a user attempts to bid beyond their limit, the UI will block the action and present an upgrade prompt.

2.  **Session-Aware Agent Interactions:**
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** All agent API calls (`/api/agents/*`) will be session-aware.
    *   **Mechanism:** The backend will use the user's JWT to create a scoped Supabase client instance. This instance will fetch the specific user's profile, settings, and history.
    *   **Personalization:** The agent's context and prompts will be dynamically built using the user's session data, ensuring all advice, analysis, and lead generation is tailored to them.
    *   **History Persistence:** All conversations will be saved and linked to the user's ID, allowing for persistent, stateful interactions on a per-bid or per-session basis.

3.  **Tier-Based Feature Gating & Upgrade Flow:**
    *   **UI Logic:** The frontend, particularly the `EnhancedChatManager` and `Dashboard`, will use a `useUser` hook to get the contractor's current `tier`.
    *   **Locked Features:** For "Growth" tier users, premium agent commands (`@rex` for search, `@alex` for advanced quotes) will be visually disabled (e.g., grayed out with a lock icon).
    *   **Upgrade Path:**
        1.  Attempting to use a locked feature will trigger a modal explaining the benefits of the "Scale" tier.
        2.  A clear "Upgrade Now" CTA will direct the user to the `/contractor/settings` page or initiate the Stripe Checkout flow directly.
        3.  Upon successful payment, a Stripe webhook updates the user's `tier` in Supabase.
        4.  The frontend `useUser` hook will automatically reflect this change, unlocking the feature without requiring a page reload.

### üåü NEW: System Constraints & Conversational Enforcement

To ensure a robust and fair platform, the following system-level constraints will be implemented, with enforcement handled conversationally by the agents to maintain a seamless user experience.

1.  **Chat Session Limits:**
    *   **Growth Tier:** Limited to **10** concurrent chat sessions.
    *   **Scale Tier:** Limited to **30** concurrent chat sessions.
    *   **Enforcement:** When a user attempts to open a new chat beyond their limit, the `EnhancedChatManager` will block the action. `Lexi` will then deliver a generative UI message explaining the limit and offering two options: close an existing chat or upgrade their plan.

2.  **Messages Per Chat Limits:**
    *   **Growth Tier:** Limited to **50** messages per chat thread.
    *   **Scale Tier:** Limited to **200** messages per chat thread.
    *   **Enforcement:** When a user reaches their message limit within a thread, `Lexi` will deliver a message explaining the limit has been reached for that specific conversation and suggest starting a new chat for a new topic or upgrading for higher limits.

4.  **Concurrent Agentic Execution Limits:**
    *   **Any Tier:** Maximum **2** concurrent AI agent operations per account.
    *   **Enforcement:** When a user attempts to start a third agent operation, the system will queue the request and display an estimated wait time. Visual progress indicators show active operations similar to ChatGPT's deep research UI.

5.  **Document Upload Limits:**
    *   **Max File Size:** Individual document uploads (e.g., certifications, proof of work) will be limited to **20MB**.
    *   **Enforcement:** The `DocumentUploader` component will validate the file size on the client side before upload, providing immediate feedback if the file is too large.

6.  **UI Layout Principle:**
    *   The main contractor dashboard will be redesigned to be **chat-centric**, with the `EnhancedChatManager` occupying approximately **70%** of the primary view. The lead feed and other modules will be positioned as secondary, supporting elements.

### üí≥ TIERED SYSTEM & PAYMENT LOGIC:

| Feature | Growth Tier (Free) | Scale Tier ($250/month) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Platform Fee** | 10% of job value | 7% of job value |
| **Payout Structure** | 30% Upfront, 40% Mid-Project, 30% Completion | 50% Upfront, 25% Mid-Project, 25% Completion |
| **Max Bids / Month**| 10 | 50 |
| **Max Active Chats** | 10 | 30 |
| **Messages / Chat** | 50 | 200 |
| **Max Services** | 5 | 15 |
| **Rex Search Agent**| Conversational Upsell | ‚úÖ Enabled (10 sessions/month) |
| **Alex Quote Agent**| Conversational Upsell | ‚úÖ Enabled |

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Stripe Integration:**
    *   Implement Stripe Checkout for the `$250/month` "Scale" tier subscription.
    *   Create webhook endpoints in `/api/payments/stripe` to handle subscription events (`created`, `canceled`, `payment_failed`).
    *   Update the `contractor_profiles` table with `tier` (`growth` | `scale`) and `stripe_customer_id` columns.

2.  **Tiered Access Control:**
    *   Implement middleware or component-level checks to enforce feature access based on the contractor's tier.
    *   Build the UI for "locked" features, providing a clear upgrade path.

3.  **Payout & Job Completion Flow:**
    *   Implement the payout logic based on the defined tiered structure.
    *   Create a workflow where final payment is released only after the contractor uploads proof of work (images) and the homeowner confirms completion.
