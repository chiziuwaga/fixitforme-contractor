#### 3. **JSON Response Format Standardization** ✅

All agents now use consistent structured output for generative UI:

```json
{
  "message": "Conversational response with clear explanations",
  "ui_assets": {
    "type": "component_type",
    "data": { /* structured data for rendering */ },
    "render_hints": {
      "component": "ReactComponentName", 
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "interactive": true
    }
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "action_identifier",
      "label": "User-facing button text", 
      "style": "primary|secondary|outline"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Technical Implementation Details:
