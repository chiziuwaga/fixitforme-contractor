# Agent JSON Assets Specification

## Overview
Each agent in the FixItForMe platform returns structured JSON responses that include both conversational text and UI assets for generative rendering in the chat interface.

## JSON Assets Count by Agent

## Generative UI Architecture

### Response Structure
\`\`\`typescript
{
  "message": "Conversational response text",
  "ui_assets": {
    "type": "component_type",
    "data": { /* Component-specific data */ },
    "render_hints": {
      "component": "ReactComponentName",
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "interactive": true|false
    }
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "action_type",
      "label": "Button text",
      "style": "primary|secondary|outline"
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

### Rendering Logic
- **High Priority**: Renders immediately with full interactivity
- **Medium Priority**: Renders with loading state, then full features
- **Low Priority**: Renders as summary card, expands on click

### Performance Considerations
- Components lazy-load heavy visualizations (D3.js charts)
- Data is cached for repeat interactions
- Animations are reduced on lower-powered devices

## Integration with Enhanced Chat System

The `EnhancedChatWindow.tsx` component handles all JSON asset rendering through the `GenerativeUIRenderer` function, which:

1. Parses the `ui_assets` field from agent responses
2. Maps asset types to React components
3. Passes data and actions to appropriate components
4. Handles unknown asset types gracefully

This ensures a consistent, interactive experience across all agent interactions while maintaining type safety and performance.
