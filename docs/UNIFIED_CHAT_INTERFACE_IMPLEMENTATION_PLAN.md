## üéØ **Executive Summary**

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to refactor the FixItForMe chat system into a single, unified, and professional interface.

*   **Inspiration**: The architecture is heavily inspired by the Vercel AI Chatbot (`demo.chat-sdk.dev`), leveraging its proven three-panel layout and component structure.
*   **Objective**: To replace our current fragmented chat components (`EnhancedChatWindow`, `MobileLexiChat`, etc.) with a central `UnifiedChatInterface` that is robust, maintainable, and provides a superior user experience.
*   **Core Principle**: We will build a set of modular, reusable sub-components within a new `src/components/ui/chat/` directory, which will be composed by the main `UnifiedChatInterface`. This ensures a clean separation of concerns and mirrors best practices from the reference implementation.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Blueprint (Vercel Model)**

Our architecture will directly mirror the successful patterns of the Vercel AI Chatbot.

### **Three-Panel Layout**

The entire interface is contained within a single parent component, divided into two main sections.

1.  **Sidebar (`<ChatSidebar />`)**: A collapsible panel on the left (320px width) containing:
    *   **Agent Selection**: Buttons to switch between Lexi, Alex, and Rex.
    *   **Conversation History**: A chronologically grouped list of all chat threads.
    *   **User/Settings Footer**: Access to user profile and settings.

2.  **Main Chat Area (`<ChatArea />`)**: The primary interaction space, containing:
    *   **Chat Header**: Displays the currently active agent and chat controls.
    *   **Messages Container**: A scrollable area that renders the conversation history, including user messages, assistant responses, and our dynamic UI assets.
    *   **Chat Input**: The text area for user input, including quick actions and the send button.

### **State Management**

A single, unified state will be managed at the top-level `UnifiedChatInterface` component and passed down as props to the sub-components. This state will be powered by our existing, sophisticated hooks (`useUser`, `useEnhancedChatThreads`, `useChatProduction`) to ensure seamless backend integration.
