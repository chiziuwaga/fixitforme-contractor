- Safe to run manually for maintenance

### `npm run otp:cleanup-prod`

## üìã Usage Examples

```bash
# First-time setup
npm run analytics:deploy

# Check analytics data
npm run analytics:check

# Clean up expired OTPs locally
npm run otp:cleanup

# View environment variable differences
npm run vercel:sync

# Production OTP cleanup (requires CRON_SECRET_KEY)
npm run otp:cleanup-prod
```

## üîê Required Environment Variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `CRON_SECRET_KEY` (for production cleanup)

## üìà Analytics Data Structure

The analytics system tracks these event types:
- `send_attempt` - User requested OTP
- `send_success` - OTP successfully sent via WhatsApp
- `send_failure` - Failed to send OTP
- `verify_attempt` - User attempted to verify an OTP
- `verify_success` - OTP verification successful
- `verify_failure` - OTP verification failed
- `expired` - OTP expired without verification

Each event includes contextual data such as error codes, timing information, and user metadata to help optimize the verification flow.
